The means and variances of the helpfulness scores for both products and customers are expected to vary significantly, and we verified it when we picked 3 customers and 3 products. In this case, the means of the helpfulness votes in customers varied between 5.85, 6.12, and 28.08, while the variances varied between 62.58, 110.71, and 3979.03. As for the helpfulness votes in products, their means varied between 1.51, 1.58, and 11.53, and their variances varied between 48.42, 88.25, and 1178.32.
One can expect these results to vary because different products may have very different helpfulness scores (depending on the number of reviews they have and how much these reviews are considered helpful). This also applies to customers, as the number of reviews that they write may vary from one customer to another.
